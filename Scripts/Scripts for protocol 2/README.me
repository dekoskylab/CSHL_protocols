# Antibody Data Analysis from Diverse Immune Libraries 

Efficient data analysis of antibody library screening data requires careful data processing and and interpretation after antibody functional screening studies and high-throughput sequencing. Here, we provide a detailed protocol  for the functional analysis of paired antibody heavy and light chain genes, including antibody repertoire quantification and functional mapping for antibody high-throughput screening data . Overall, this protocol enables a user to apply a set of simple yet powerful tools for high-throughput analysis and interpretation of antibody data,  and is especially well suited for antibody display library screening and for antibody discovery applications.
