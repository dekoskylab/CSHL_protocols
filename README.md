# Protocol description

-Protocol 1: Clonal Variant Analysis of Antibody Engineering Libraries  
  This protocol described a general method for tracking antibody clonal variants in display systems. In the example provided, the antibody vFP16.02 was diversified using site-saturation mutagenesis. 
  This methods generates all possible one amino acid mutations across the variable region on the heavy chain and light chain. The sample data provided consists on heavy chain variants sorted against two HIV Envelope proteins with different fusion peptide sequences. After quality control, sequences are aligned against the template antibody and the frequency of each variant is calculated. A custom script analyzed the frequency of each varaint across sorting rounds and calculates an enrichment ratio.

-Protocol 2: Antibody Data Analysis from Diverse Immune Libraries 
  This protocol is works in a similar way as Protocol 1. However, the input are immune libraries, which need to be aligned to germline V(D)J sequences.Next, clonal frequencies are calculated and the prevalence of each clone is calculates across sorting rounds. The prevalence is used to calculate an enrichment ratio. The sample data consist on immune libraries from donors recovering from ZIKV infection. Yeast libraries were sorted against ZIKV VLPs.
