# Protocol description

-Protocol 1: Clonal Variant Analysis of Antibody Engineering Libraries  
  This protocol described a general method for tracking antibody clonal variants in display systems. In the example provided, the antibody vFP16.02 was diversified using site-saturation mutagenesis. 
  This methods generates all possible one amino acid mutations across the variable region on the heavy chain and light chain. The sample data provided
